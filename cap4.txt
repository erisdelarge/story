from the spacial port, emerge.... a chicken! A Martian chicken, with a space helmet, with two antennas on it. The chicken was bigger than normal - I mean - terrestrial chicken: it's height was equal to a 10 year old kid's one, it's feathers were colored in vivid shades of blue, red and orange, and it's eyes were red - well, that's similar to our terrestrial chickens. Anyway - it was a little bit intimidating at first. 
It's staring at me! Was thinking the human waitrass, standing in front of the portal.
